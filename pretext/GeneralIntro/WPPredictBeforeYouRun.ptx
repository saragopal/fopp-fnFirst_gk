  <title>Predict Before You Run!</title>
  <p>You've run your first program! You'll be doing that a lot in this book and the programs will
    become increasingly
    complicated. One way to help understand what is happening and learn programming is predicting
    the effect of running a
    snippet of code before actually running the program. Later on in your development, you may make
    predictions about large
    snippets of code, but for now you will typically be predicting the effect of executing a single
    line of code. A prediction
    will either be about what gets printed out, or about the value of a variable, or that an error
    will occur.</p>
  <p>A prediction is not a random guess. It is based on some explanation you have about what the
    current state of
    variables is and about what you think certain commands in Python do.</p>
