  <title>The Python Programming Language</title>
  <p>The programming language you will be learning is Python. Python is an example
            of a <term>high-level language</term> that is designed to be easily read by humans and where 
            the human does <em>not</em> need to have specific knowledge about the computer 
            hardware. Other high-level languages you might have heard
            of are C++, PHP, and Java.</p>
  <p>As you can infer from the name high-level language, there are also
            <term>low-level languages</term>, sometimes referred to as machine languages or assembly
            languages. Loosely speaking, low-level languages use numerical codes or symbols to tell the 
            computer how to process and move data. Generally, computers can only execute programs written in
            low-level languages. Thus, programs written in a high-level language have to be
            processed before they can run. This extra processing takes some time, which is
            a small disadvantage of high-level languages.
            However, the advantages to high-level languages are enormous.</p>
  <p>First, it is much easier to program in a
            high-level language. Programs are shorter so they take less time
            to write, and being easier to read, they are easier to correct. Second, high-level languages are <term>portable</term>, meaning that they can
            run on different kinds of computers with few or no modifications. Low-level
            programs are based on the hardward for a particular kind of computer system 
            and have to be rewritten to run on another.</p>
  <p>Due to these advantages, almost all programs are written in high-level
            languages. Low-level languages are used for a few specialized
            applications where, being designed for a specific kind of computer, they can run very fast.</p>
  <p>Two kinds of programs process high-level languages into low-level languages:
            <term>interpreters</term> and <term>compilers</term>. An interpreter reads a high-level program
            and executes it, meaning that it does what the program says one line at a time. It 
            alternates between reading lines and performing computations.</p>

  <p>A compiler reads the program and translates it completely before the program
            starts running. In this case, the high-level program is called the <term>source
                code</term>, and the translated program is called the <term>object code</term> or the
            <term>executable</term>. Once a program is compiled, you can execute it repeatedly
            without further translation.</p>
  <image source="GeneralIntro/Figures/compile.png" width="50%" alt="Compile illustration"/>
  <p>Like many modern languages, Python uses both processes. Programs are first compiled into a lower
            level language, called <term>byte code</term>, and then interpreted by a program called
            a <term>virtual machine</term>. <em>Because of the way
            programmers interact with it (often adding individual lines of code and then running their programms), 
            and because of the speed of modern computers, Python is usually considered an interpreted language.</em></p>
  <p>For the core material in this book, you will not need to install
            or run Python natively on your computer. Instead, you'll be writing simple
            programs and executing them right in your browser.</p>
  <p>However, if you are using this book for a course, you will need a complete Python environment, rather than the limited environment
            available in this online textbook. To do that, either
            install Python and an <term>integrated development environment</term> on your computer so that it can run natively, or use a remote server that provides a
            command line shell or IDE.</p>
