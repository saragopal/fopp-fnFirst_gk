  <title>Introduction: The Way of the Program</title>
  <p>The goal of this book is to teach you to understand and create computer programs in Python.
            At the beginning of each chapter, we will outline for you the learning goals and objectives
            that should be accomplished once you have gone through the chapter.</p>
  <p>Understanding computer programs requires a very step-by-step approach where
  each step is very specifically expressed. When executed (run), programs are the sequences of actions performed
            that transform input data into output data. They execute very reliably, and
            very fast, but not creatively. <alert>Computers do what you tell them to do, not what you
            mean for them to do.</alert> Thus, understanding computer code
            involves a lot of mental simulation of what will <em>actually happen</em>, not what you
            wish would happen.</p>
  <p>The tools we use to write computer programs can feel quite mechanistic - precise, specific, and linear, but
          the process of programming requires creative
            problem solving. Problem solving involves the ability to understand and analyze problems, to think
            creatively about solutions, and to express a solution clearly and accurately. As
            it turns out, the process of learning to program is an excellent opportunity to
            practice your problem solving skills.</p>
