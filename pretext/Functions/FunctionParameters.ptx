  <title>Function Parameters</title>
  <p>Remember that functions are very useful because, once they are defined and we understand what they do, we can
    refer to them by name and no longer have to think too much about their inner workings. The functions then can be treated as
    separate tools that we can use repeatedly and in conjunction with other functions to solve a larger <em>decomposed</em> problem.
</p>
<p>If we can give values to a function so it can perform its task in a more customized way, they are even more powerful. Doing 
   so allows us to generalize a function's actions so that it can do the same thing each time it is called/invoked, 
    but with different starting values. </p>
<p>The function <c>feet_to_miles()</c>below implements the calculation of a formula. It expects a value when it is called and uses
   the value to calculate its result. The formula is always the same, but it used whatever number it is given. 
</p>

<program xml:id="ac4_5_1_params" interactive="activecode" language="python">
  <input>
  def feet_to_miles(ft):
      miles = ft / 5280
      miles = round(miles, 1)
      print(ft, "feet is", miles, "miles.")

  feet_to_miles(10560)
  feet_to_miles(30000)
  </input>
</program>

<p>Let us revisit <term>"The GK Golden Rules for Calling Functions"</term> with a focus on Rule #3 &#8212;</p>
<p>
  <table>
    <tabular>
      <row>
        <cell>
          (1) In order to use a function we have to call it.
        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          (2) When we call a function, we always put a pair of parentheses after the name of the function.
        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          <term>(3) The type and number of values that belong in the parentheses in a function call (arguments) must match the 
          rules for the function signature (parameters)</term>.
        </cell>
      </row>
      <row>
        <cell>
          (4) If the function returns a value, we must capture it into a variable with an assignment statement (or
           use the value in some other way, like print it).
        </cell>
      </row>
    </tabular>
  </table>
</p>
<p>The signature (first line) for the definition of <c>feet_to_miles()</c> is different from <c>say_hello()</c> in the previous sections because 
the paretheses are not empty. Specifically, there is a variable called <c>ft</c> mentioned. When this function <c>feet_to_miles()</c> executes, it uses 
 <c>ft</c> to generate a new numeric value (called "miles"). Depending on the value passed into <c>ft</c>, a different resulting value for <c>miles</c> is
 calculated and displayed to the screen.</p>
 <p>A <term>parameter</term> is a variable that is introduced to a function in the signature (in the parentheses). Parameters get their initial
 value when the function is called.</p>
<p> How does the function know what value to use for its parameter called <c>ft</c>? Notice that the function calls (lines 6 and 7) each have a numeric value inside the 
  parentheses. This value is mapped to the parameter <c>ft</c>, like an invisible assignment statement.
</p>

<p>Here are some function that require one value (or more) from the caller:</p>
<program xml:id="ac4_5_2_params" interactive="activecode" language="python">
  <input>
  def hello2(name):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("I hope you have an excellent day!")

  def hello3(name, age):
    print("Hello,", name)
    print("On your next birthday, you will turn", age + 1)

  hello2("Amalia")
  hello2("Tedwin")
  hello3("Timo", 17)
  </input>
</program>

<p> Notice that the signature for <c>hello2()</c> has one paremeter (variable name in the parentheses). The function call
  on line 9 assigns "Amalia" to <c>name</c>. The function call on line 10 assigns <c>name</c> to the value 
  "Tedwin". Also, tell yourself "<c>name</c> is a <term>parameter</term>." </p>

<p>The function <c>say_hello3()</c> has a different signature. Specifically, there are <em>two</em> parameters. This implies that 
calls to this function must include <em>two</em> values in the parantheses of the function call. On line 11, there is a call 
to <c>say_hello3()</c> and there are two values sent to the function. The first one gets mapped to <c>name</c> and the 
second one gets mappted to <c>age</c>. This is the behavior you would expect and we can be grateful that it works this way.</p>  
<!--    
  <p>The figure below shows a function's relationship with its parameters. A function needs certain information to do its specific work.
    These values, often called <term>arguments</term>, <term>actual parameters</term> or <term>parameter
    values</term>, are <em>passed</em> to the function by the code that invokes the function.</p>
  <image source="Functions/Figures/blackboxproc.png" width="50%" />
  <p>This type of diagram is often called a <term>black-box diagram</term> because it only states
    the requirements from the perspective of the 'user' (well, the programmer, but the programmer who
    writes the code that uses the function, who may be different than the programmer who created the function - which, by the way, is why docstrings are 
    so useful to explain a function). The 'user'
    must know the name of the function and what arguments it needs to be passed. The details of how the
    function works are hidden inside the <q>black-box</q>.</p>
  <p>You have already been making function invocations with parameters. For example, when you write <c>len("abc")</c>, <c>len</c> is 
  the name of a function, and the string <q>abc</q> is a parameter value. Or <c>print("Answer", 3 - 4, sep=" is equal to ")</c> where the print function is passed three
    parameters: a string, an expression and a named parameter.</p>
  <p>When a function has one or more parameters, the following holds:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
        The names of the parameters appear in the function definition
    </li>

    <li>
        The parameters are separated by commas
    </li>

    <li>
        The values in the parentheses of the function invocation are assigned to the parameters <em>in the same order</em>
    </li>
  </ol> 
  <p>In the function definition, the <term>parameter list</term> is sometimes referred to as the <term>formal parameters</term>, <term>ideal parameters</term>
    or <term>parameter names</term>. These names can be any valid variable name.</p>
  <p>In the function invocation, inside the parentheses one value should be provided for each of the
    parameter names. These
    <term>arguments</term> can be specified directly (<c>"abc"</c>),  by any Python
    expression (e.g. <c>3 - 4</c>) including a
    reference to some other variable or function name (<c>abs(3 - 4)</c>), or by name 
    (also known as keyword arguments - like <c>speed = 5.4</c> or <c>sep = " is equal to "</c>.</p>
  <p>That can get kind of confusing, so let's start by looking at a function with just one
    parameter. The revised hello
    function personalizes the greeting: the person to greet is specified by the parameter.</p>
  <program xml:id="clens4_4_1" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
      def hello2(s: str) -&gt; None:
        print("Hello " + s)
        print("Glad to meet you")

      hello2("Iman")
      hello2("Jackie")
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>First, notice that hello2 has one formal parameter, <c>s</c>. You can tell that because
    there is exactly one variable name inside the parentheses on line 1 
    (the colon and the 'str' are part of Type Annotation, a topic we will discuss shortly).</p>
  <p>Next, notice what happened during Step 2. Control was passed to the function, just like we saw
    before. But in addition, the variable<c>s</c> was bound to a value, the string <q>Iman</q>. When it
    got to Step 7, for the second invocation of the function, <c>who</c> was bound to <q>Jackie</q>.</p>
  <p>Function invocations always work that way. The expression inside the parentheses on the line
    that invokes the function
    is evaluated before control is passed to the function. The value is assigned to the
    corresponding formal parameter.
    Then, when the code block inside the function is executing, it can refer to that formal
    parameter and get its value,
    the value that was <em>passed into</em> the function.</p>
  <exercise runestone="eval4_4_1" />
  <p>To get a feel for that, let's invoke hello2 using some more complicated expressions, but one where we use more self-documenting parameter names. 
  Feel free to modify things on your own - allowing them to 'break' but then fixing things too.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac4_4_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      def hello2(who: str) -&gt; None:
          print("Hello " + who)
          print("Glad to meet you")

      hello2("Iman" + " and Jackie")
      hello2("Class " * 3)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>Now let's consider a function with two (not all that self-documenting) parameters. Can you determine what the two variables are? What they are for?</p>
  <program xml:id="clens4_4_2" interactive="codelens" language="python">
    <input>
      def hello3(s: str, n: int) -&gt; None:
          greeting = f"Hello {s} "
          print(greeting*n)

      hello3("Wei", 4)
      hello3("", 1)
      hello3("Kitty", 11)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>At Step 2 of the execution, in the first invocation of hello3, notice that the variable <c>s</c> is
    bound to the value <q>Wei</q> and the variable <c>n</c> is bound to the value 4.</p>
  <p>That's how function invocations always work. Each of the comma separated expressions inside the
    parentheses are evaluated to produce values. Then those values are matched up positionally (in the same order)
    with the formal parameters of the function definition. The first parameter name is bound to the first value
    provided. The second parameter name is bound to the second value provided. And so on.
    </p>
    <p>
    <em>Try writing your own version of the program above, but pass the arguments in the reverse order, e.g. <c>hello3(4, "Wei")</c>.
    What happens when you run the code? It should produce a <term>runtime error</term> - an error that happens
    when the code is <em>syntactically correct</em> and runs, but encounters an issue during execution; in this case, it
    can't deal with the variables being of a different than expected data type.</em></p>
