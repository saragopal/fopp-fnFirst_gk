  <title>Variables and parameters are local</title>
  <p>As has been discussed previously, when we use variables we have to first use assignment statements to create them and initialize with a value. Similarly, 
  we define functions in the code before the code can invoke them. Computer science uses the term <term>scope</term> to describe 
  where/when an identified item (like a variable, a function etc.) is recognizable and accessible. Calling a function or using a variable before
  its definition or assignment will trigger a runtime error because the item is outside of the program's scope at that moment.</p>
  <p>Scope becomes an even more important issue when large problems are decomposed with functions. Within
  a function, its parameters (and any other variable defined in the function's body) can only be accessed by code within the same scope.
  These <term>local variables</term> only exists inside the function and you cannot use them outside of them. For example, consider the following version of the <c>square</c> function:</p>

  <note>
    <p>We've omitted the docstring, type annotations, and have used non-self-documenting names in the following example on purpose,
    to put you into a similar position as the code's interpreter - it can only 'do' what the code tells it to 
    and cannot 'know' what it is supposed to do. But it will follow the scope rules.</p>
  </note>
  <program xml:id="ac4_8_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
def square(x):
    y = x * x
    return y

z = square(10)
print(y)
print(x)
print(z)

        </input>
  </program>
  
  <p><em>Trace the code manually first. Make note of which variables are 'inside' the function's scope.</em></p>
  <p>Next, click on <em>Show in CodeLens</em> and step through the code with the <c>Next</c>&gt; button to follow the <term>flow of execution</term>. CodeLens indicates the scope of the variables with 'Frame' boxes. Variables whose scope is <alert>local</alert> to the function will be placed in a named box, and
    <term>global variables</term> (defined outside of the function) will stay in the global frame.</p>

    <p>Go through the steps until you see an error message. When we try to access <c>y</c> on line 6 (outside the
            function's scope), Python looks for a global variable named <c>y</c> but does not find one. This results in the runtime error:
            <c>NameError: name 'y' is not defined.</c></p>

  <p> <em>This is neither a syntax nor a semantic error - line 6 is syntactically correct and the algorithm is valid </em> however...</p>

  <p>The local variable <c>y</c> only exists while the function is being executed &#x2014; we call this its <term>lifetime</term>. When the
            execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed and the code passes outside of the function's scope. 
            CodeLens helps you visualize this because the function's local variables disappear after the function returns to the function caller's scope (line 5).</p>
  <p>Go back and step through the statements again, paying
            particular attention to the variables that are created when the function is called and note when they are subsequently
            destroyed with the function's return. </p>
  <p>Use <c>Edit this code</c> to delete line 6 <c>print(y)</c> and take a moment to work out for yourself what will now happen.
  Then <c>Visualize Execution</c> and proceed through all the steps. Answer for yourself <em>what happened? Why?</em></p>

  <p>By tracing the algorithm (the <term>flow of execution</term>) and watching the CodeLens frames (scope), you can see that formal parameters are local variables; 
  their scope is limited to within their function. For example, after <c>square</c> is called, the local variable <c>x</c> exists with the function's body (lines 2 and 3). The lifetime of all local variables (including parameters) then ends when the function completes its execution and the scope passes back to the calling instruction (line 3's <c>return</c> to line 6).</p>

  <p><note>When a function assigns and uses a local variable, upon completing its execution, it is not possible to recover that local variable the next time it is called.
      Each call of the function creates new local variables, and their lifetimes expire when the function returns to the caller's scope.</note></p>

      <p><em>Try stepping through the code again. Look for, understand and fix any other runtime errors</em>.</p>
