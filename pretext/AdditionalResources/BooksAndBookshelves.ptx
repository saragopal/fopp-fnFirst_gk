    <title>Comprehensive Practice Program: Books and Bookshelves</title>
    <p>This exercise is designed to give you some experience working with objects and classes. It is
        advised that you've completed the Classes exercises
        before attempting.</p>
    <p> You're given two classes, <c>Bookshelf</c> and <c>Book</c>. <c>Book</c>s have a few
        properties: a <c>title</c>, an <c>author</c>, and a <c>year of publication</c>. We set these
        when instantiating the book. A <c>Bookshelf</c> only has one property: a <c>books</c> list.
        It's empty by default. </p>

    <program language="python">
        <input>
            class Book:
                def __init__(self, title: str, author: str, year: int):
                    self.title = title
                    self.author = author
                    self.year = year


            class Bookshelf:
                def __init__(self):
                    self.books = []

                def add_book(self, book: Book) -&gt; None:
                    self.books.append(book)
        </input>
    </program>
    <subsection xml:id="subsec-additonal_resources-books-bookshelves-adding-books">
        <title>Adding Some Books</title>
        <p>Using the class templates from above, create a file, <c>main.py</c>, and instantiate a 
        <c>Bookshelf</c> object. Then, create a few <c>Book</c> objects and add them to the 
        <c>Bookshelf</c> object. </p>
        <p>
            Here are some books you can use:

<subsection xml:id="additonal_resources-books-bookshelves-confirming-books">
        <title>Confirming Book Data</title>
        <p>It's important to make sure the data you're parsing ends up in the right places.
        Create a method in the <c>Book</c> class called <c>get_data()</c> to return the book's information.
        I really like APA, so format it like this:</p>
        <program language="python">
            <input>
                book = Book("No Longer Human", "Osamu Dazai", 1948)
                print(book.get_data()) # Dazai, O. (1948). No Longer Human.
            </input>
        </program>
        <p>
            Now loop through every book on the shelf and print out its data.

            <note>
                <title>Hint</title>
                <p>
                    It may be a good idea to utilize fstrings and the <c>.split()</c> method.
                </p>

<subsection xml:id="additonal_resources-books-bookshelves-searching-books">
        <title>Searching for Books</title>
        <p>
            Now that all the book data is loaded in the <c>Bookshelf</c> object, let's create a few
            methods to search for books.

            </p>
            <p>
            Create a method in the <c>Bookshelf</c> class called <c>get_book_by_name()</c> that takes
            a string as an argument and returns the book with the matching name. If no book is found,
            return <c>None</c>. Don't worry about case sensitivity for now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Create another method in the <c>Bookshelf</c> class called <c>get_book_by_author()</c>
            that takes a string as an argument and returns the book with the matching author by last name. If no
            book is found, return <c>None</c>. Again, don't worry about case sensitivity for now, and don't worry about
            authors with multiple books. For now, each author only has one book.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, create a method in the <c>Bookshelf</c> class called <c>get_book_by_year()</c> that
            takes an integer as an argument and returns the book with the matching year. If no book is
            found, return <c>None</c>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, create a method in the <c>Bookshelf</c> class called <c>get_book_by_position()</c>
            that takes an integer as an argument and returns the book at the matching position. If no
            book is found, return <c>None</c>.
        </p>
    </subsection>
    <subsection xml:id="additonal_resources-books-bookshelves-adding-more-books">
        <title>Filling Up Bookshelves</title>
        <p>
            Now that you're able to search for books, let's fill up the bookshelf with some more books.
            Take the following list of books and save it as a text file. Then, write a function
            called <c>load_books()</c> that reads the file, turns each line into a <c>Book</c> object,
            and adds it to the <c>Bookshelf</c> object. You shouldn't need to use any
            <c>try</c>/<c>except</c> blocks for this.

        <p>
            You're gonna need to make some edits to some existing functions. Not all these authors have a last name, so you'll have to use their first name without an initial.
Also, a few searching methods may need to be revised. Some books may have been written in the same year, or by the same author. Change the <c>get_book_by_author()</c> and <c>get_book_by_year()</c> methods to return a list of all matching <c>Book</c> objects. If the search returns only one match, the list will contain only one item. If the search returns nothing the list will be empty.

        <title>Final Touches</title>
        <p>
            There are a few extra methods to include, just to add some more functionality and fix some issues.
        </p>
        <p>
            There were a lot of classics on that list, so add a method to the <c>Bookshelf</c> class that returns a list of books written before a specified year. Make sure
            this method returns a list of <c>Book</c> objects. Also, make sure the year is inclusive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some authors appear on that list more than others. Write a method that returns a list of authors that have more than one book on the shelf. Make sure this method returns a list of strings, not <c>Book</c> objects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, there are some books that have been replaced by newer copies on the shelf. Write a method that finds any duplicate books and removes the older copies. Have this method return the number of books removed.
