    <title>The Command Line</title>
    <p>The <term>command line</term>, or CLI, is a powerful tool that provides direct access to the
        core functionalities of your operating system. While graphical interfaces are widely used,
        understanding the command line and its basic usage is essential for quickly navigating file
        systems, managing source control, and running programs.</p>
    <subsection xml:id="command_line-git-bash">
        <title>GitBash</title>
        <p>For this section, GitBash will be used as the command line interface. GitBash is a
            command line interface that is included with Git for Windows. It is a Bash shell
            emulator that provides a Linux-like CLI environment on Windows. GitBash can be
            downloaded from <url href="https://gitforwindows.org/" visual="https://gitforwindows.org/">https://gitforwindows.org/</url>
            .</p>
        <p>Once GitBash is installed, it can be opened through a shortcut, or by right-clicking in a
            folder and selecting <guibutton>Git Bash Here</guibutton>.</p>
        <p>GitBash will open in the current directory. The command line prompt will be displayed,
            followed by the current directory. The prompt will be different depending on the
            operating system. For Windows, the prompt will be <literal>$</literal>. For Linux and
            Mac, the prompt will be <literal>%</literal>.</p>

    <subsection xml:id="command_line-commands">
        <title>Commands</title>
        <p> Command lines allow users to interact with the operating system by entering commands.
            Commands are entered into the command line, and then executed by pressing the <keycap>
            Enter</keycap> key. Commands can be entered one at a time, or multiple commands can be
            entered on the same line by separating them with a semicolon. </p>
        <subsection xml:id="command_line-commands-navigation">
            <title>Navigation Commands</title>
            <p> Arguably the most important command is <c>cd</c>, which is used to
                change directories. Directories are the folders that contain files. The current
                directory is displayed in the command line prompt. To change directories, enter <c>cd</c> followed by the name of the directory. For example, to change to the <em>
                src</em> directory, enter <c>cd src</c>. </p>
            <p> In order to navigate into a parent directory - that is, the directory that contains
                the current directory - use <c>cd ..</c>. For example, if the current
                directory is <em>src</em>, then <c>cd ..</c> will change to
                the parent directory. </p>
            <p> Next, the <c>ls</c> command is used to list the contents of the current
                directory. This command will list the files and directories in the current
                directory. For example, if the current directory contains the files <em>
                main.py</em> and <em>README.md</em>, then <c>ls</c>
                will list these files. Folders, when listed, will not have a file extension, and
                instead will be followed by a forward slash. For example, if the current directory
                contains the folder <em>src</em>, then <c>ls</c> will list <em>
                src/</em>. </p>
        </subsection>
        <subsection xml:id="command_line-commands-files_directories">
            <title>File and Directory Commands</title>
            <p> To create a new directory, use the <c>mkdir</c> command. For example, to
                create a new directory named <em>src</em>, enter <c>mkdir src</c>
                . </p>
            <p> To create a new file, use the <c>touch</c> command. For example, to
                create a new file named <em>main.py</em>, enter <c>touch main.py</c>
                . </p>
            <p> To remove a file, use the <c>rm</c> command. For example, to remove the
                file <em>main.py</em>, enter <c>rm main.py</c>. Be warned,
                this command will permanently delete the file. </p>
