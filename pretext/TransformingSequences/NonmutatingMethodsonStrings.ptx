  <title>Non-mutating Methods on Strings</title>
  <p>There are a wide variety of methods for string objects.
    Try the following program.</p>
  <program xml:id="ac9_9_1" interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
      ss = "Hello, World"
      print(ss.upper())

      tt = ss.lower()
      print(tt)
      print(ss)
    </input>
  </program>
  <p>In this example, <c>upper</c> is a method that can be invoked on any string object to create a
    new string in which all the characters are in uppercase. <c>lower</c> works in a similar fashion
    changing all characters in the string to lowercase. (The original string <c>ss</c> remains
    unchanged. A new string <c>tt</c> is created.)</p>
  <p xml:id="transforming-sequences_string-methods" names="string_methods">You've already seen a few
    methods, such as <c>count</c> and <c>index</c>, that work with strings and are non-mutating. In
    addition to those and <c>upper</c> and <c>lower</c>, the following table provides a summary of
    some other useful string methods. There are a few activecode examples that follow so that you
    can try them out.</p>

    <title>FStrings</title>
    <p>Until now, we have created strings with variable content using the + operator to concatenate
      partial strings together. That works, but it's very hard for people to read or debug a code
      line that includes variable names and strings and complex expressions. Consider the following:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_4" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        name = "Rodney Dangerfield"
        score = -1 # No respect!
        print("Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score))
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>Or perhaps more realistically:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_5" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
        for person in scores:
          name = person[0]
          score = person[1]
          print("Hello " + name + ". Your score is " + str(score))
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>In this section, you will learn to write that in a more readable way:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_6" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        scores = [("Rodney Dangerfield", -1), ("Marlon Brando", 1), ("You", 100)]
        for person in scores:
          name = person[0]
          score = person[1]
          print(f"Hello {name}. Your score is {score}.")
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>In grade school quizzes a common convention is to use fill-in-the blanks. For instance,</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Hello _____!</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and you can fill in the name of the person greeted, and combine given text with a chosen
      insertion. <em>We use this as an analogy:</em> Python has a similar construction, better
      called fill-in-the-braces. <c>fstrings</c>, make substitutions into places in
      a string enclosed in braces. Run this code:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_7" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        person = input('Your name: ')
        greeting = f"Hello {person}!"
        print(greeting)
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>There are several new ideas here!</p>
    <p>An <c>fstring</c> has a special form, where the string must start with an <c>f</c> outside the quotations, and with braces embedded. The data embedded in the braces will be substituted into the string. There
      are many variations on the syntax between the braces.</p>
    <p>In the code above, this new string is assigned to the identifier <c>greeting</c>, and then
      the string is printed.</p>
    <p>The identifier <c>greeting</c> was introduced to break the operations into a clearer sequence
      of steps. However, since the value of <c>greeting</c> is only referenced once, it can be
      eliminated with the more concise version:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_8" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        person = input('Enter your name: ')
        print(f'Hello {person}!')
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>There can be multiple substitutions, with data of any type.
      Next we use floats. Try original price $2.50 with a 7% discount:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_9" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
        discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
        newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
        calculation = f'${origPrice} discounted by {discount}% is ${newPrice}.'
        print(calculation)
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>If you used the data suggested, this result is not satisfying.
      Prices should appear with exactly two places beyond the decimal point,
      but that is not the default way to display floats.</p>
    <p>fstrings can give further information inside the braces showing how to specially format
      data. In particular floats can be shown with a specific number of decimal places. For two
      decimal places, put <c>:.2f</c> inside the braces for the monetary values:</p>
    <program xml:id="ac9_9_10" interactive="activecode" language="python">
      <input>
        origPrice = float(input('Enter the original price: $'))
        discount = float(input('Enter discount percentage: '))
        newPrice = (1 - discount/100)*origPrice
        calculation = f'${origPrice:.2f} discounted by {discount}% is ${newPrice:.2f}.'
        print(calculation)
      </input>
    </program>
    <p>The 2 in the format modifier can be replaced by another integer to round to that
      specified number of digits.</p>
    <p>This kind of format string depends directly on the order of the
      parameters to the format method. There are other approaches that we will
      skip here, such as explicitly numbering substitutions.</p>
    <p>A technical point: Since braces have special meaning in a format string, there must be a
      special rule if you want braces to actually be included in the final <em>formatted</em>
      string. The rule is to double the braces: <c>{&#x200B;{</c> and <c>}&#x200B;}</c>. For example
      mathematical set notation uses braces. The initial and final doubled braces in the format
      string below generate literal braces in the formatted string:</p>
    <pre>a = 5
b = 9
setStr = 'The set is {&#x200B;{&#x200B;{a}, {b}&#x200B;}&#x200B;}.'
print(setStr)</pre>
    <p>Unfortunately, at the time of this writing, the ActiveCode format implementation has a bug,
      printing doubled braces, but standard Python prints <c>{5, 9}</c>.</p>
