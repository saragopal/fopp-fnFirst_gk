    <title>Foreword to the Functions First Edition</title>
    <p>By Charlotte Curtis</p>
    <p>This "Functions First" edition is an adaptation of the original Foundations of Python Programming book that places an emphasis on learning to <em>program</em>, not learning to program <em>in Python</em>. This book was created for Mount Royal University's introductory programming course, where students learn Python first and then follow up with C++ or Java depending on their major. The following changes were made:
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                As suggested by the name, functions were moved much earlier in the book and are introduced as the major programming construct. We have observed that functions are one of the most challenging concept for beginners, so the early introduction provides the opportunity to practice this concept throughout the course.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Most turtle graphics examples were removed to keep the focus on terminal programs.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Python-specific data structures and patterns like dictionaries, list comprehension, tuple packing and unpacking were removed to maintain a focus on the core programming concepts.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Iteration was rearranged to introduce <c>while</c> before <c>for</c> loops in order to emphasize the initialization, condition, update pattern.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Several chapters such as sorting, testing, and inheritance were removed to keep the content consistent with a single semester course.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

        The majority of the adaptation was done by Matthew Hrehirchuk, with supervision and edits by Eric Chalmers, Charlotte Curtis, and Patrick Perri. Support for this adaptation was provided by Mount Royal University Library's <url href="https://library.mtroyal.ca/open/resources">OER adaptation grant</url> program.
