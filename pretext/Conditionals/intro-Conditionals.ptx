  <title>Intro: What we can do with Conditionals</title>
  <p>So far, our programs have been a series of statements which always execute sequentially. But sometimes programs must change the statements they execute depending on the situation. For example, a messaging app might only set a message's title bold if it has not been read by the user. Or a video game needs to update the position of all the characters that are not asleep. This is done with something called a <term>selection</term> or a <term>conditional statement</term>.</p>
  <p>
    The following program changes the message that is printed, based on user input:
  </p>

  <program interactive="activecode" language="python">
    <input>
temperature_str = input("enter temperature in degrees celsius")
temperature_num = float(temperature_str)

if temperature_num > 37.8:
    print("fever")
else:
    print("normal")
    </input>
  </program>

  <p>
    The program above accepts a body temperature from the user and checks to see if it indicates a fever. Lines 4-7 contain <term>conditional statements</term>. If the temperature is greater than 37.8 the print statement on line 5 executes, otherwise the print statement on line 7 exectutes. Conditional statements like this create a branching effect in our program: the program no longer runs strictly sequentially.
  </p>
  <p>This chapter will further detail how to use conditional statements.</p>
